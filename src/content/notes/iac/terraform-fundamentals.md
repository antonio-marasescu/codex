Terraform is a popular infrastructure as code tool for managing cloud resources.

## Key Concepts

- **Providers**: Plugins that define and manage resources
- **Resources**: Infrastructure objects managed by Terraform
- **State**: Terraform's record of managed resources
- **Modules**: Reusable infrastructure components

## Basic Workflow

1. Write Terraform configuration
2. Initialize the working directory
3. Plan the changes
4. Apply the configuration

## Best Practices

- Use version control
- Implement remote state storage
- Use workspaces for environment separation
