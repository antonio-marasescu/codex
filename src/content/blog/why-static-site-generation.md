# Why Static Site Generation Matters

Static site generation (SSG) has become increasingly popular for modern web applications. Let's explore why.

## Performance Benefits

Static sites load faster because they're pre-rendered at build time, eliminating the need for server-side rendering on each request.

## SEO Advantages

Search engines can easily crawl and index static content, leading to better search rankings.

## Security

With no server-side code execution, static sites are inherently more secure.

## Cost Effectiveness

Static sites can be hosted on CDNs at minimal cost while providing excellent performance globally.
